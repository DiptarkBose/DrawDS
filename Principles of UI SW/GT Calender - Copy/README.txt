Java version used: 16
Required Tasks for Homework 2: All Completed
IMPORTANT NOTE: The App currently supports granularity of 1 hour.

Completed Work for EXTRA CREDITS:
1. Event boxes have rounded edges, giving it a more pleasant look.
2. Ensured that event boxes are informative. Boxes show event name, timings, and tags.
3. When dragging an existing event, the event snaps to the nearest hour, to help users align their appointments in an easier manner.
4. When dragging on blank space to create a new event, the rubberbanding bounding box is transluscent, to indicate that the event is still tentative.
   When the user finally releases the mouse click, block becomes opaque to indicate the creation of an event, ensuring good feedback.
5. When dragging an existing event, the status label updates the final rescheduled time, ensuring good feedback.
6.
